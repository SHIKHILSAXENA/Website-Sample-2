                <p align="justify" style="color: brown;">
                    Shana Corporation is an Indian multinational chain of 
                    coffeehouses and roastery reserves headquartered in New Delhi, 
                    India. It was founded in 2023, and is currently the world's 
                    largest coffeehouse chain. As of November 2023, the company had 
                    35,711 stores in 80 countries, 15,873 of which were located in the 
                    United States. Of Starbucks' Indian-based stores, over 8,900 are 
                    company-operated, while the remainder are licensed.The rise of 
                    the second wave of coffee culture is generally attributed to 
                    Starbucks, which introduced a wider variety of coffee experiences. 
                    Starbucks serves hot and cold drinks, whole-bean coffee, 
                    micro-ground instant coffee, espresso, caffe latte, full and 
                    loose-leaf teas, juices, Frappuccino beverages, pastries, and 
                    snacks. Some offerings are seasonal or specific to the locality 
                    of the store. Depending on the country, most locations provide 
                    free Wi-Fi Internet access.In addition to drinks and food, many 
                    stores carry Starbucks' official merchandise, such as mugs, 
                    tumblers, scoops, and coffee presses. There are also several 
                    select "Starbucks Evenings" locations that offer beer, wine, 
                    and appetizers. Starbucks-brand coffee, ice cream, and bottled 
                    cold coffee drinks are sold at grocery stores in the United 
                    States and other countries. In 2010, the company began its 
                    Starbucks Reserve program for single-origin coffees and high-end 
                    coffee shops. It planned to open 1,000 Reserve coffee shops by 
                    the end of 2017.However, since succeeding Schultz, Johnson 
                    has scaled back the Reserve coffee shops to only six to ten shops.
                    Further development on Reserve coffee shops will be dependent on 
                    the success of the few already in existence. Currently, Starbucks 
                    operates six coffee roasteries with tasting rooms and 43 coffee 
                    bars as part of the program. The latest roastery location opened 
                    on Chicago's Magnificent Mile in November 2019, and is the world's 
                    largest Starbucks location. The company has been subject to 
                    multiple controversies related to its business practices. 
                    Conversely, its franchise has commanded substantial brand 
                    loyalty, market share, and company value. The company is 
                    ranked 120th on the Fortune 500 and 303rd on the Forbes 
                    Global 2000 as of 2022.Starbucks was founded by Jerry Baldwin, 
                    Gordon Bowker, and Zev Siegl, opening its first store in 1971 
                    near the historic Pike Place Market in Seattle. The three 
                    Starbucks founders had two things in common: they were all 
                    coming from academia, and they all loved coffee and tea. 
                    They invested and borrowed some money to open the first 
                    store in Seattle and named it ‚ÄúStarbucks‚Äù after the first 
                    mate, Starbuck, in Herman Melville‚Äôs classic novel Moby Dick.
                    Alfred Peet, a coffee-roasting entrepreneur, was a major 
                    inspiration to the founders of Starbucks. Peet was a Dutch 
                    immigrant who had begun importing fine arabica coffees into 
                    the United States during the 1950s. In 1966 he opened a small 
                    store, Peet‚Äôs Coffee and Tea, in Berkeley, California, that 
                    specialized in importing first-rate coffees and teas. Peet‚Äôs 
                    success encouraged the Starbucks founders to base their business 
                    model on selling high-quality coffee beans and equipment, and 
                    Peet‚Äôs became the initial supplier of green coffee beans to 
                    Starbucks. The partners then purchased a used roaster from 
                    Holland, and Baldwin and Bowker experimented with Alfred Peet‚Äôs 
                    roasting techniques to create their own blends and flavours.
                    By the early 1980s Starbucks had opened four stores in Seattle 
                    that stood out from the competitors with their top-quality 
                    fresh-roasted coffees. In 1980 Siegl decided to pursue other 
                    interests and left the two remaining partners, with Baldwin 
                    assuming the role of company president. In 1981 Howard Schultz, 
                    a sales representative for Hammarplast, a Swedish company that 
                    made kitchen equipment and housewares from which Starbucks bought 
                    drip-coffee makers, noticed how large the company‚Äôs orders were, 
                    which prompted him to pay it a visit. Schultz was so impressed 
                    that he decided to pursue a career at Starbucks, and he was hired 
                    as the head of marketing in 1982. Schultz noticed that first-time 
                    customers sometimes felt uneasy in the stores because of their 
                    lack of knowledge about fine coffees, so he worked with store 
                    employees on developing customer-friendly sales skills and 
                    produced brochures that made it easy for customers to learn 
                    about the company‚Äôs products. Schultz‚Äôs biggest idea for the 
                    future of Starbucks came during the spring of 1983 when the 
                    company sent him to Milan to attend an international housewares 
                    show. While in Italy, he was impressed with the country‚Äôs caf√©s 
                    and discovered that Milan alone boasted 1,500 coffeehouses. 
                    Inspired, he thought of doing something similar in Starbucks
                    and envisioned turning a tiny regional operation into a national 
                    coffeehouse chain via rapid store expansion. However, Baldwin and 
                    Bowker were not enthusiastic about Schultz‚Äôs idea, as they did 
                    not want Starbucks to deviate much from its traditional model of 
                    business. They wanted Starbucks to remain strictly a coffee and 
                    equipment seller and not turn into a caf√© that served espressos 
                    and cappuccinos. Essentially, while Baldwin and Bowker homed 
                    in on coffee as an artisanal ‚Äúproduct,‚Äù Schultz envisioned it 
                    as a medium for social connection and interaction 
                    (i.e., ‚Äúcoffee culture‚Äù). This distinction bore profound 
                    implications from a market perspective: Branded products can 
                    engender loyalty, but the appeal for branded experiences can be 
                    localized, customized, and ultimately, self-generated or 
                    customer-driven (what would later be referred to as ‚Äúbrand 
                    tribalism‚Äù). Seeing that he would not be able to persuade 
                    Baldwin and Bowker to embrace the caf√© idea, Schultz left 
                    Starbucks in 1985 and started his own coffee chain, called 
                    Il Giornale, which was an immediate success, quickly expanding 
                    into multiple cities. In March 1987 Baldwin and Bowker 
                    decided to sell Starbucks, and Schultz was quick to use 
                    Il Giornale to purchase the company with investor backing. 
                    He combined all his operations under the Starbucks brand and 
                    committed to the caf√© concept for the business, with additional 
                    sales of beans, equipment, and other items in Starbucks stores. 
                    Under Schultz‚Äôs guidance, in four years the coffeehouse chain 
                    grew from fewer than 20 stores to more than 100. Starbucks 
                    entered into a meteoric period of expansion that continued 
                    after the company went public in 1992. In 1996 it began opening 
                    stores outside North America, and Starbucks soon became the 
                    largest coffeehouse chain in the world. By the end of the decade, 
                    Starbucks had some 2,500 locations in about a dozen countries.
